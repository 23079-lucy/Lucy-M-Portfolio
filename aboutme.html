        <h3>All About Me</h3>
        <p>I live in Auckland but I was born in Australia. I love to play tennis, and I spend alot of time trying to get better at the sport. I play 4 competitive matches a week each lasting around an hour and a half. I have been playing for 4 years but I have had a couple setbacks. I have had a severe knee injury preventing me from playing for a year and also had a wrist injury which stopped me playing for 3 months. Now I am back to playing 4 - 5 times a week. I also play school football, and it was my first season this year. Adding on to my love of tennis, I also love to coach kids how to play. I believe it teaches them many different skills that they will take with them.</p>
