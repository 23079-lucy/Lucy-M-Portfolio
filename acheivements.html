        <h3>My Acheivements</h3>
        <p>Striving for acheivements has helped motivate me in my studies and in my competitions.
            I have had many Academic and Sporting acheivements in my time at school, some include:
            <ul>
                <li>Top Academic Girl 2020</li>
                <li>Mason cup 2 years in a row</li>
                <li>Most Valuble Player Netball team 3</li>
                <li>Qualified Tennis Coach</li>
            </ul>
            These acheivements are the results of my hard work and dedication, and it helps that I love to do these things to. I am currently working towards getting a higher degree of my coaching qualification, and this will lead to even more things that I wish to acheive.
