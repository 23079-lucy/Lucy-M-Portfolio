        <h3>My Extra Curriculars</h3>
        <p>I have many diffrent extra curriculars that I do before and after school. Firstly I love playing sports, and I dedicate alot of time towards my football and tennis. I play tennis at least 4 times a week and football twice. I also am a qualified tennis coach, and I work with kids ages 5-10 and teach them how to play tennis and important life lessons that they learn through the sport. I also go to the gym when I have time to try and get stronger for my sports. By doing these extra curriculars I have learned time management skills, dedication and hard work.</p>
